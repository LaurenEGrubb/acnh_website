### **_Description_**
#### This is my first project working with REACT js wherew I built a database that the user can interact and manipulate with. It features a review page that goes to the specific villager that is selected on the Villagers' Page and when you write in the text box and hit refresh, you can see you review. From there you can either select delete (and refresh) or type in the text box again and select edit for the comment you wish to change. While there are still more features to be implemeneted and perfected, I'm extremely proud of the work accomplished in this project in so little time.
